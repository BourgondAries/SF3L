SF3L
====

Simple, Fast 3D Library.

This is a little graphical library that I'm creating, that plugs right into SFML! I have copied SFML's simplicity so that it should be very easy for others to start coding in 3D!

This version is not finished.

My definition of Simple in SF3L:
 - Simple to use. This does not mean simple uses. I will try to add as much of OpenGL as I can, this includes the stencil buffer, fog, quadrics,...


====

TODO:

 - Insert 4-channel colors (RGBA) instead of 3-channel RGB
 - Finish the normal calculations for triangles and rectangles
 - Work on advanced lighting
 - Create quadric hierarchy
 - Add fog manager
 - Automate functionality, e.g. glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST) or glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);

... more coming, can't think of anything else right now...
